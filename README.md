# Code_repository
 Repository for all my coding needs

# Reasons
 As I'm learning to code, there is so much to remember and use. I am building a place to store, recall, and easily filter information that I don't use every day.

## Structure
 I will more than likely adjust the structure of this repository as I go, but for now it will be as follows:
 - Cheat Sheets
   - Different languages and concepts
 - Snippets
   - Code blocks to be reused
 - General topics
   - Basic thoughts and topics not covered above
