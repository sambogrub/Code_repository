# Code_repository
 Repository for all my coding needs

# Reasons
    As I'm learning to code, there is so much to remember and use, that I need a place to store, recall, and easily filter information that I don't use every day.

## Structure
    I will more than likely adjust the structure of this repository as I go, but for now it will be as follows:
    - Cheat Sheets
      - Different languages and concepts
    - Snippets
      - Different languages
    - Projects
      - Personal projects to build my portfolio
    - General topics
      - Basic thoughts and topics not covered above
