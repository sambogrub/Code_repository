# Natural Language Processing
 

 - Language models are probabilistic computer models of language
   - Popular one is the unigram model or 'Bag-of-words'
 - Neural Language Models, trying to train a language model to match our brains approach to language
 - Levenshtein Distance, minimal edit distance between two words
 - NLTK common NLP Python library
 - corporas - body of text
 - lexicon - dictionary, words and their meanings

## Concepts
 - Noise Removal
   - stripping text of formatting (e.g. HTML tags)
 - Tokenization
   - Breaking text into individual words or sentences
 - Normalization
   - Stemming
     - Getting rid of word prefixes and suffixes
   - Lemmatization
     - bringing words down to their root forms
   - Stopwords removal
   - spelling correction
   - lowercasing


## Parsing text
 - Part-of-speech (POS tagging) identifies parts of speech (nouns, adj)
 - Named entity recognition (NER) finds proper nouns
 - Dependency grammer helps understand the relationship between words in a sentence
 - Regex parsing (using pythong's re library)
